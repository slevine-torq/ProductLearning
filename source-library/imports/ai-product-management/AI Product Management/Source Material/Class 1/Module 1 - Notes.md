## 1. Course Introduction

This course is a six-module certification in AI Product Management. It is fully **individual**: no group breakouts, no team deliverables, no group presentations. Every exercise comes with two solo mechanics:

- **Self-review checklist**: bullets you tick against your own artifact.
- **Async share**: commit to your `juno-pm/` repo and post the link in `#ai-pm-cohort`. The instructor responds in-thread within ~5 days.

Certification is based on your individual repo submission within 7 days of cohort end.

### The scenario

You are the AI PM at **RocketShip**, a hyper-growth B2B SaaS platform for Enterprise Data Teams. On paper the company is winning; in reality you are the bottleneck. P0 escalations stack up, support sits on thousands of tickets, sales velocity stalls. The org has innovation budget but **zero** for headcount.

You will spend the course designing and building **Juno PM**: an AI Associate PM that lives inside your existing tools (Slack, Notion, Jira) and handles three pillars:

1. **Synthesize Insights**: transform the multi-channel roar of transcripts, tickets, and calls into structured, evidence-backed clarity.
2. **Draft Specs**: turn raw findings into high-fidelity "Version 0.1" PRDs.
3. **Prioritize Risks**: flag unclear edge cases, technical debt, and risky assumptions.

The deliverable across the course is your **`juno-pm/` GitHub repo fork**: six folders (`01-prompting/` through `06-evals/`) plus a top-level `README.md` that is your one-page pitch.

## 2. The AI-First Product Mindset

The PM role is bending around a single technical fact: **AI outputs are non-deterministic.** Same input, variable output. Drift, hallucination, variance.

Every PM craft you know, specs, UX, QA, launch, has to bend around that. This table is the spine of the course. Each module reinforces one row.

| Traditional PM assumption | What AI broke |
|---|---|
| Outputs are deterministic | Outputs are probabilistic, drift, hallucination, variance |
| Spec is a doc | Spec is a doc + prompt + data corpus + eval set |
| UI is command-driven | UI is intent-driven and often invisible |
| Workflows are sequential | Workflows are agentic, branched, conditional, handed off |
| Ship + monitor with analytics | Ship + eval harness + human rubric + guardrails |

### The PM's dual role

You are the broker between probabilistic behaviour and human trust.

- **Inward**: translate non-determinism into product specs your team can build against (prompt, RAG, eval, guardrail).
- **Outward**: translate non-determinism into user expectations the product can honour (trust UX, confidence cues, escape hatches).

Engineers will not own the user-trust side. Designers will not own the eval side. You do.

### The PM's AI toolkit

Five tool categories every AI PM should have one of in their bookmarks:

| Category | Pick one | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt-to-prototype | Lovable, v0, Cursor | Build a working UI in minutes |
| LLM playground | OpenAI Playground, Anthropic Console | Tune prompts + hyperparameters |
| No-code agent builder | Langflow, n8n | Wire agents and tool calls |
| Eval / observability | LangSmith, Phoenix, Braintrust | Score, trace, regress |
| Repo + version control | GitHub | Your `juno-pm/` lives here |

> Use **`M1 - PM Toolkit Picker.html`** to pick one tool per category. Working notes only. Not a `juno-pm` file.

## 3. The Anatomy of a High-Quality Prompt

Every production prompt declares **five elements**. If any is missing, output will drift.

1. **Context**: who the AI is, what system it lives in, what it knows.
2. **Task**: the explicit instruction (verb-first).
3. **Constraints**: must-not-do, format requirements, scope boundaries.
4. **Output format**: schema, length, structure (markdown / JSON / table).
5. **Examples** (few-shot, when useful), 1 to 3 ideal input/output pairs.

> Use **`M1 - Prompt Anatomy Builder.html`** to write the Lovable prompt and to fill `01-prompting/lovable-prototype.md` (prototype link, what it demonstrates, debrief).

## 4. Hands-On Lab: Prompt-to-Prototype Your Copilot with Lovable

**Format: individual, 25 minutes.**

1. Open Lovable, sign in (free tier is enough).
2. Paste this seed prompt:

```
Build a web app called "Juno PM". It is the homepage for an AI Associate PM that lives inside Slack, Notion, and Jira. The homepage has:
- A hero strip with the tagline "Scale your judgment, not yourself"
- A three-column section explaining the pillars: Synthesize Insights, Draft Specs, Prioritize Risks
- A chat-style input at the bottom with placeholder text "Paste a wall of escalations..."
- A side panel showing the last 3 risks Juno flagged

Use a calm professional palette, deep navy, off-white, one accent color. No emojis.
```

3. Iterate **once**: change the UI shape, palette, or copy.
4. Copy the shareable URL.
5. Commit the URL to `01-prompting/README.md` in your `juno-pm/` fork.

**Goal:** a functional URL by end of timebox. Not a polished product.

## 5. Prompting as Product Configuration

Once you treat the prompt as **configuration**, every technique becomes obvious.

### The Prompting Strategy Matrix

| Technique | Use when |
|---|---|
| Zero-shot | Simple instruction; the model already knows the domain |
| Few-shot | You need a specific format or style, show 1 to 3 examples |
| Chain-of-thought | Multi-step reasoning required |
| System prompt + role | Persona, persistent guardrails, organisation context |

### Hyperparameters: the two PM dials

- **Temperature.** 0 ≈ deterministic. 1+ = creative. Spec for the job. Juno-as-risk-watchdog = low temperature. Juno-as-brainstorm-partner = higher.
- **Max tokens / response length.** Cap it. Long outputs hide failures. Short outputs force prioritisation.

Top-p, frequency penalty, presence penalty, nice-to-have, not must-have for PM-side decisions.

## 6. Individual Exercise: Configure Juno's System Prompt

**Format: individual, 30 minutes.** (This was previously a breakout group exercise. Now solo.)

This is the **M1 deliverable** for the final project.

### Steps

1. Open `M1 - System Prompt Configurator.html` in the `Modules/` folder.
2. Fill in: **Role & objective**, **Context & knowledge**, **Rules & guardrails**, **Output format**, **Few-shot examples**.
3. Click **Copy as markdown** and paste over `01-prompting/system-prompt.md`. The file should keep those five headings.

### Self-review checklist

- Role names who Juno is and the single job.
- Context names sources and boundaries.
- Rules include at least 3 bullets and 1 refusal.
- Output format declared (markdown, schema, length cap).
- A few-shot example for the trickiest case.

### Async share

Commit, push, and post the link to your `01-prompting/system-prompt.md` in `#ai-pm-cohort` with a 1-paragraph reflection on what you cut, what you kept, and what you'd add if you had another hour.

## 7. The Optimization Decision Framework

Three levers. Cheapest first.

| Lever | Try when | Cost / time |
|---|---|---|
| **Prompt** | The model already knows the domain, behaviour needs tuning, not knowledge | Minutes. Almost free. |
| **RAG** | You need to ground the model in *your* data (M3) | Days. Real infra cost. |
| **Fine-tune** | Style/format/behaviour matters more than retrieval. Last resort. | Weeks. Real training cost. |

**If you can fix it with the prompt, do not build infra.**

### The Role of Fine-Tuning: mostly, don't

- Fine-tuning bakes behaviour into weights. Powerful, but inflexible.
- Fine-tunes drift: base models update, your fine-tune doesn't.
- Use when: format / tone / persistent behaviour at scale, and you have 1000+ high-quality examples.
- Do not use when: facts change weekly, you don't have an eval harness yet, or a system prompt + few-shot would work.

Most working PMs will never own a fine-tune. Know the decision criteria so you can push back when an engineer suggests it prematurely.

## 8. From PRDs to Prompts

In an AI-native team, the PRD is no longer the only source of truth. The full spec is now:

- The **PRD** (what & why)
- The **system prompt** (how the AI behaves), M1
- The **data corpus + retrieval rules** (what it knows), M3
- The **eval set** (how we know it's working), M6

You will commit all four to your `juno-pm/` repo by M6.

---

## Key takeaways

1. Prompting is configuration, not chat.
2. Every prompt declares context, task, constraints, output format, examples.
3. Optimization order: prompt → RAG → fine-tune. Cheapest first.
4. You have a working Lovable URL for Juno + a committed system prompt.
5. Next: M2, is this bet worth oxygen, and how autonomous can it be?

---

## Before Module 2 (~20 min)

- Skim **`Module 2 - Pre-Read.md`** (Three-Layer Model + AI Strategy One-Pager).
- Confirm your `juno-pm/` repo exists and contains the M1 artifacts (`system-prompt.md`, `lovable-prototype.md`).
- Post your M1 reflection in `#ai-pm-cohort` if you haven't.
- Bring **one real AI bet from your day job** to M2. We will pressure-test it.
