# Module 4: Design AI-Native User Experiences (Shareable Notes)

A faithful expansion of the Module 4 slides. Individual format throughout.

By the end of this module you commit two artifacts to `04-ai-ux/`:

- `04-ai-ux/user-flow.md`, Juno's AI user flow for one pillar, with 7 nodes specified
- `04-ai-ux/trust-gaps.md`, the three trust gaps scored, with explicit mitigations

(Optional, post-class) `04-ai-ux/screenshots/`, updated Juno surfaces from the AI-native rework.

## 1. Intent-Driven AI Design Systems

The UX we've come to accept but shouldn't have:

- Chat boxes everywhere → cognitive load.
- "Magic wand" buttons with unclear scope.
- No confidence cues → user can't tell when to trust.
- No escape hatches → user can't steer or stop.

You can have the best model, the cleanest RAG, the tightest evals, and still lose to a competitor whose UX:

- Reveals reasoning when it matters.
- Surfaces confidence visually.
- Lets the user steer in one click.
- Gets out of the way when the AI is wrong.

UX is where trust is built or destroyed. Spec it like a feature, not a polish task.

## 2. Designing Invisible UI for AI-Native Outcomes

**Invisible by design** is the default for AI-native UX. The system anticipates intent and acts at the right moment instead of waiting at a chat box.

| Wrong default | Right default |
|---|---|
| Juno is a chat tab in the sidebar. PM must remember it exists, open it, type. | Juno surfaces a prioritised risk panel in Slack #escalations the moment a P0 thread crosses 5 messages. |

### Mapping Value to UX Treatment

Pick UX patterns by value frame, not aesthetic.

| Value frame | UX treatment | Juno example |
|---|---|---|
| Cost reduction | Background automation with audit trail | Auto-tag P0/P1 on incoming Slack threads |
| Revenue generation | Inline assist at the moment of decision | "Draft spec from this thread" button in Slack |
| Risk mitigation | Proactive flag + reason + one-click action | Daily top-3 risks panel in #pm-daily |
| User delight | Anticipatory suggestion, dismissible | "Looks like this thread is going P0, want a summary?" |

For Juno (Risk-mitigation primary), the dominant UX treatment is **proactive flag + reason + one-click action.**

## 3. How to Architect an AI User Flow

### The AI Iceberg

| Tip (what users see) | Underwater (what runs) |
|---|---|
| Trigger | Capture context |
| Surface | Retrieve from corpus |
| Confirm / Correct | Reason (model call) |
| | Act (tool calls, writes) |
| | Log (evals, traces) |
| | Guardrail checks |
| | Fallback paths |

Most PMs design the tip and hand-wave the underwater. **Spec both.** The underwater is engineering territory, but PMs spec what happens at each step (when to retrieve, what to log, what fallback).

### The Seven Nodes

Every AI user flow has these seven nodes:

1. **Trigger**: what initiates the flow.
2. **Capture**: what context the system gathers.
3. **Retrieve**: what data is pulled in.
4. **Reason**: what the model decides.
5. **Act**: what happens in the world (send / write / call).
6. **Surface**: what the user sees.
7. **Confirm / Correct**: how the user steers, accepts, overrides.

> Use **`M4 - AI User Flow Architect.html`**: spec all 7 nodes for one Juno pillar; mark tip vs. underwater per node; export to `04-ai-ux/user-flow.md`.

### Individual Exercise: Architect Juno's Core AI User Flow (30 min)

This is the M4 deliverable. (Was previously a breakout group exercise. Now solo.)

1. Pick **one** Juno pillar to flow first (recommendation: Prioritize Risks).
2. Open `M4 - AI User Flow Architect.html`.
3. Spec the 7 nodes. Be specific (e.g., Trigger = "new P0 tagged in #escalations and ≥5 messages in 10 min").
4. Mark tip vs. underwater per node.
5. Copy as markdown → `04-ai-ux/user-flow.md`. The live preview is the file. No ChatGPT or Claude step.

#### Self-review checklist

- The user flow names a real trigger (not "user opens app").
- Each of the 7 nodes has one specific line.
- Tip vs. underwater is marked per node.
- The Act node names specific tool calls.
- The Surface node specifies where (Slack channel / Notion / Jira block).

#### Async share

Commit, push, post link in `#ai-pm-cohort` with a 1-paragraph reflection.

## 4. The PM's Playbook for Closing AI Trust Gaps

Three gaps. Close all three or you don't ship.

| Gap | Question | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Black-box** | Can the user see *why*? | Reasoning, citations, "show your work" |
| **Hallucination** | Could this confidently be wrong? | Confidence cues, source links, escape hatches |
| **Control** | Can the user steer or stop? | Undo, edit, regenerate, "don't suggest this again" |

> Use **`M4 - AI-UX Trust Gap Checker.html`**: score each gap, write mitigations, add intelligence-tax row, export to `04-ai-ux/trust-gaps.md`.

### Managing the Intelligence Tax

The extra latency or cognitive load the user must endure for AI value is a product surface.

- Spec the maximum acceptable latency (p95).
- Decide whether to stream output (perceived latency drops dramatically).
- Decide whether to show "Juno is reasoning…" (transparency vs. distraction).
- If the intelligence tax exceeds the value frame, kill the feature.

## 5. Optional Post-Class Lab (Individual): Reimagine Juno as an AI-Native Copilot

- Move Juno out of a standalone chat tab.
- Embed it directly into Slack/Jira/Notion, proactive surfaces, not reactive chat.
- If the user never had to type a prompt, how would Juno still deliver value?
- Update your Lovable URL or commit a screenshot to `04-ai-ux/screenshots/`.

Async-share-only. Instructor responds in `#ai-pm-cohort` thread.

## Key takeaways

1. Chat-in-a-tab is the wrong default.
2. Invisible by design, anticipate intent.
3. Map value → UX treatment. Don't pick UX patterns by aesthetic.
4. The AI Iceberg has 7 nodes. Spec all of them.
5. Close all three trust gaps before shipping.

## Before Module 5 (~20 min)

- Skim **`Module 5 - Pre-Read.md`** (agent spectrum, ReAct, Planner-Executor, memory).
- Re-read your `04-ai-ux/user-flow.md`'s **Act** node, M5 turns it into an Agent Workflow Spec.
- Post your AI-UX links in `#ai-pm-cohort` if you haven't.

## Learning objectives (mapped to outcomes)

| LO | What you produced |
|---|---|
| Evaluate the evolution of AI design systems | The "wrong vs. right default" reflection in `user-flow.md` |
| Analyze the strategic placement of AI interactions | Value-to-UX mapping in `trust-gaps.md` |
| Construct a comprehensive AI user flow | `04-ai-ux/user-flow.md` (7 nodes, tip+underwater) |
| Formulate a strategy to mitigate AI trust gaps | `04-ai-ux/trust-gaps.md` (three gaps + intelligence tax) |
