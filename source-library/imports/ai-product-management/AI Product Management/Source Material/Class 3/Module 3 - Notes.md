# Module 3: Improve AI Product Requirements with RAG Architecture (Shareable Notes)

A faithful expansion of the Module 3 slides. Individual format throughout.

By the end of this module you will commit two artifacts to `03-rag-prd/`:

- `03-rag-prd/before-after-rag.md`, diagnostic from the hands-on lab
- `03-rag-prd/ai-prd.md`, Juno's AI PRD with explicit RAG architecture (the M3 deliverable)

## 1. The Power of Context and Context Engineering

The big shift in M3:

| Prompt engineering | Context engineering |
|---|---|
| Words to the model | Data assembled *around* the prompt |
| Shared between engineer and PM | **PM-owned** |
| Tunes behaviour | Grounds output in *your* reality |

Engineers own retrieval mechanics. **PMs own what should be retrieved and why.** If you don't take this, no one does.

## 2. Overview: The RAG Process

Retrieval-Augmented Generation in 4 steps:

1. **Index**: chunk your corpus, embed each chunk, store in a vector DB.
2. **Retrieve**: at runtime, fetch relevant chunks for the query.
3. **Augment**: inject retrieved chunks into the prompt as context.
4. **Generate**: model responds, grounded in your data.

Reduces hallucination. Adds cost + latency. The PM trade-off is **what to retrieve and when**.

### How RAG works in practice

- **Chunking**: break long docs into 500 to 1500 token chunks. Smaller = more precise; larger = more context.
- **Embedding**: convert each chunk to a vector. Pick a model (OpenAI text-embedding-3, Cohere, voyage-3).
- **Vector store**: Pinecone, Chroma, pgvector, Weaviate. PM-irrelevant unless cost matters.
- **Retrieval strategy**: top-k similarity, hybrid (keyword + vector), reranker on top of k.

You do not need to operate the vector DB. You need to know the levers exist.

## 3. Hands-On Lab: Improve Juno's Capabilities With RAG (25 min, individual)

1. Open your Juno Lovable prototype (from M1).
2. Ground Juno in the **RocketShip Strategy One-Pager** corpus, paste the doc into Lovable's context, or use the lab's seed corpus.
3. Ask Juno: *"What are the top 3 risks for our Q3 enterprise tier launch, with citations?"*
4. Compare the answer **before** grounding vs. **after**.
5. Save both answers in `03-rag-prd/before-after-rag.md`.

**Goal:** see *"no longer guessing, now citing."*

## 4. Mapping RAG To Your AI PRD

### What's new in an AI PRD?

A traditional PRD plus **three new sections**:

1. **Data corpus + retrieval strategy**: what data, indexed how, retrieved how.
2. **Eval plan**: golden set, success bar, regression cadence (M6 fills this).
3. **Failure modes + guardrails**: what can go wrong, what blocks it.

Skip these and you ship a probabilistic system with no idea how it will fail.

### The Three Key RAG Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Lever | Watch |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | Embedding model size, storage volume, retrieval calls/query | $/query at production scale |
| **Speed** | k, reranker on/off, hybrid retrieval, parallelism | p95 latency budget |
| **Accuracy** | Chunk size, retrieval k, reranker quality, query rewriting | Eval score on golden set (M6) |

**The right context at the right time beats more context every time.**

## 5. RAG Costs, Control, and Trade-offs

### Architecture Decision Factors (5 questions)

1. **Data freshness**: how stale can context be? (Seconds / hours / days)
2. **Corpus size**: fits in context window vs. must be retrieved?
3. **Query latency budget**: how fast must this return?
4. **Update cadence**: read-heavy or write-heavy?
5. **Privacy / tenancy**: multi-tenant or per-user corpus?

For Juno PM at RocketShip: stale up to 1 hour is OK; corpus too big to fit in context; p95 ≤4s; write-heavy on tickets; per-team tenancy.

> Use **`M3 - RAG Architecture Decider.html`**: answer the five questions, get a recommended architecture (chunk size, retrieval, reranker, refresh cadence). Export to your PRD.

### Tokens and context windows: the hard ceiling

- Model context windows: 8k → 128k → 1M tokens.
- Cost per million tokens × usage volume = your AI margin line.
- Bigger windows are **not** free. Latency and "needle in a haystack" recall both degrade with size.

The 1M-token era doesn't kill RAG. It changes the trade-off.

### Data Preparation: the PM corpus-readiness checklist

- **Source identification**: which docs, channels, tickets, transcripts?
- **Quality bar**: minimum freshness, accuracy, completeness.
- **PII / sensitive-content handling**: redact, exclude, or pseudonymise.
- **Permissions**: does the corpus respect user-level access?
- **Update cadence**: how often does the index refresh?

## 6. Individual Exercise: Specify Juno's RAG Architecture in Your AI PRD (30 min)

This is the M3 deliverable. (Was previously a breakout group exercise. Now solo.)

1. Open `M3 - AI PRD Builder.html`.
2. Carry over the bet / mechanic / autonomy from your M2 one-pager.
3. Fill the **Data corpus + retrieval strategy** section using output from the RAG Architecture Decider.
4. Fill the **Failure modes + guardrails** section.
5. Leave the **Eval plan** as a stub, M6 fills it.
6. Copy as markdown → `03-rag-prd/prd.md`. The live preview is the file. No ChatGPT or Claude step.

> ⚠️ **Capture note:** this step names the output file `03-rag-prd/prd.md`, but every other reference in this Notes doc (the module intro, the async-share step below, and the Learning Objectives table) calls it `03-rag-prd/ai-prd.md` — matching the Final Project Brief's naming. This looks like a typo in the source material, not an intentional second file. Treat `ai-prd.md` as correct.

### Self-review checklist

- Data corpus section names **specific** sources (not "internal docs").
- Retrieval strategy specifies chunk size, top-k, and rerank on/off.
- Failure modes lists **at least 3 concrete** scenarios.
- Each failure mode has a **paired guardrail** (refusal, citation, escalation).
- Eval plan stub points to M6.

### Async share

Commit, push, and post the link to `03-rag-prd/ai-prd.md` in `#ai-pm-cohort` with a 1-paragraph reflection on which failure mode you nearly missed.

## Key takeaways

1. Prompt engineering ends where context engineering begins. PMs own context.
2. An AI PRD has 3 new sections vs. a traditional PRD.
3. The right context at the right time beats more context.
4. RAG trade-offs: cost / speed / accuracy.
5. You now have a real AI PRD for Juno with explicit architecture choices.

## Before Module 4 (~20 min)

- Skim **`Module 4 - Pre-Read.md`** (AI-UX trust gaps + iceberg).
- Pick a real AI product whose UX you find clunky. Bring one screenshot to M4.
- Post your `03-rag-prd/ai-prd.md` link in `#ai-pm-cohort` if you haven't.
